Foodly is a restaurant order taking app built in ReactJS. The potential user of the website can search through available meals, add/remove meals to/from the shopping cart, fill the order form and complete the order. The application relies heavily on Redux Toolkit for the state management, as well as uses the Firebase real-time database.
